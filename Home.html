The Holocaust, the state-sponsored persecution and murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945, is history’s most extreme example of antisemitism.</p>

 did not invent the hatred of Jews. Jews in the country of Europe had 
been discriminated against since the Middle Ages, due to their religious
 reasons. Christian people saw Jewish faith as an aberration that had to be demolished. Jewish people were sometimes forced to convert, or they would be disallowed to do certain professions.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The exact origin of Hitler’s hatred towards Jewish people is not fully understood, in his autobiography “Mein Kampf”, he says his development into antisemitic
 mindset was the result of a long, personal struggle. Supposedly, his 
aversion to everything Jewish came to fruition when he was living and 
working as a painter in Vienna (from 1908 to 1913). Researchers believe the Hitler came up with this explanation in hindsight. He would have used it to assure people who were not yet convinced of his ideas that “they would eventually see the light”. Anyhow, it's clear that Hitler was not born with antisemitic thoughts. To what extent is not certain but his prejudice against Jews whilst he was living in Vienna had not fully been concrete. Historians believe this because his most loyal buyer was a Vienna Jew named “Samuel Morgenstern.”&nbsp;</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The most loyal buyer of Hitler in his young Vienna days as a painter was Samuel Morgenstern. Samuel Morgenstern was a very big Austrian businessman who was also a jew. Samuel Morgenstern was born in 1875 as the son of Hungarian Jews in Budapest. Adolf Hitler first appeared in his Viennese shop in 1911 or 1912. Hitler's offer to include some of his pictures (especially watercolors) in Morgenstern's assortment was taken up by Glaser, who also sold picture frames. As a result, Hitler regularly supplied Morgenstern's business with his pictures until his emigration to Germany in May 1913. Morgenstern later said he bought them to fill empty frames that were for sale, attracting the customer's eye.&nbsp;</p>

The Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna had a lot of jewish staff. Hitler probably got his hatred for them when he was rejected by “foreigners” In his mind. And after the Nazi power control, the Academy was forced to fire most of its Jewish council members.&nbsp;</p>
